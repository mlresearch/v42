title: The {H}iggs boson machine learning challenge
abstract: The Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge (HiggsML or the Challenge for
  short) was organized to promote collaboration between high energy physicists and
  data scientists. The ATLAS experiment at CERN provided simulated data that has been
  used by physicists in a search for the Higgs boson. The Challenge was organized
  by a small group of ATLAS physicists and data scientists. It was hosted  by Kaggle
  at \urlhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson; the challenge data is now available
  on \url\opendataLink. This paper provides the physics background and explains the
  challenge setting, the challenge design, and analyzes its results.
