title: Higgs Boson Discovery with Boosted Trees
abstract: The discovery of the Higgs boson is remarkable for its importance in modern
  Physics research. The next step for physicists is to discover more about the Higgs
  boson from the data of the Large Hadron ColliderÂ (LHC). A fundamental and challenging
  task is to extract the signal of Higgs boson from background noises. The machine
  learning technique is one important component in solving this problem. In this paper,
  we propose to solve the Higgs boson classification problem with a gradient boosting
  approach. Our model learns ensemble of boosted trees that makes careful tradeoff
  between classification error and model complexity. Physical meaningful features
  are further extracted to improve the classification accuracy. Our final solution
  obtained an \emphAMS of 3.71885 on the private leaderboard, making us the top 2%
  in the Higgs boson challenge.
