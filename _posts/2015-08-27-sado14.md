title: Deep Learning, Dark Knowledge, and Dark Matter
abstract: 'Particle colliders are the primary experimental instruments of high-energy
  physics. By creating conditions that have not occurred naturally since the Big Bang,
  collider experiments aim to probe the most fundamental properties of matter and
  the universe. These costly experiments generate very large amounts of noisy data,
  creating important challenges and opportunities for machine learning. In this work
  we use \emphdeep learning to greatly improve the statistical power on three benchmark
  problems involving: (1) Higgs bosons; (2) supersymmetric particles; and (3) Higgs
  boson decay modes. This approach increases the expected discovery significance over
  traditional shallow methods, by 50%, 2%, and 11% respectively. In addition, we explore
  the use of model compression to transfer information (\emphdark knowledge) from
  deep networks to shallow networks.'
