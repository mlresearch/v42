title: Consistent optimization of AMS by logistic loss minimization
abstract: 'In this paper, we theoretically justify an approach popular among participants
  of the Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge to optimize approximate median significance
  (AMS). The approach is based on the following two-stage procedure. First, a real-valued
  function f is learned by minimizing a surrogate loss for binary classification,
  such as logistic loss, on the training sample. Then, given f, a threshold \hatθ
  is tuned on a separate validation sample, by direct optimization of AMS. We show
  that the regret of the resulting classifier (obtained from thresholding f on \hatθ)
  measured with respect to the squared AMS, is upperbounded by the regret of f measured
  with respect to the logistic loss. Hence, we prove that minimizing logistic surrogate
  is a consistent method of optimizing AMS. '
