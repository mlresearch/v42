title: Optimization of AMS using Weighted AUC optimized models
abstract: In this paper, we present an approach to deal with the maximization of the
  approximate median discovery significance (AMS) in high energy physics. This paper
  proposes the maximization of the Weighted AUC as a criterion to train different
  models and the subsequent creation of an ensemble that maximizes the AMS. The algorithm
  described in this paper was our solution for the Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge
  and we complement this paper describing the preprocessing of the dataset, the training
  procedure and the experimental results that our model obtained in the challenge.
  This approach has proven its good performance finishing in ninth place among the
  solutions of 1785 teams.
