title: "Weighted Classification Cascades for Optimizing Discovery Significance in
  the HiggsML\rChallenge"
abstract: We introduce a minorization-maximization approach to optimizing common measures
  of discovery significance in high energy physics. The approach alternates between
  solving a weighted binary classification problem and updating class weights in a
  simple, closed-form manner. Moreover, an argument based on convex duality shows
  that an improvement in weighted classification error on any round yields a commensurate
  improvement in discovery significance. We complement our derivation with experimental
  results from the 2014 Higgs boson machine learning challenge.
