title: Dissecting the Winning Solution of the HiggsML Challenge
abstract: The recent Higgs Machine Learning Challenge pitted one of the largest crowds
  seen in machine learning contests against one another. In this paper, we present
  the winning solution and investigate the effect of extra features, the choice of
  neural network activation function, regularization and data set size. We demonstrate
  improved classification accuracy using a very similar network architecture on the
  permutation invariant MNIST benchmark. Furthermore, we advocate the use of a simple
  method that lies on the boundary between bagging and cross-validation to both estimate
  the generalization error and improve accuracy.
